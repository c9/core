So a few days were invested on my side to implement a Johnston-inspired SHA1 hashing function with a heavy focus on performance.\n\nThe result of this process is Rusha, a SHA1 hash function that works flawlessly on large amounts binary data, such as binary strings or ArrayBuffers returned by the HTML5 File API, and leverages the soon-to-be-landed-in-firefox [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/spec/latest/) with whose support its within *half of native speed*!\n\n## Installing\n\n### Node.JS\n\nThere is really no point in doing this, since Node.JS already has a wonderful `crypto` module that is leveraging low-level hardware instructions to perform really nice. Your can see the comparison below in the benchmarks.\n\nRusha is available on [npm](http://npmjs.org/) via `npm install rusha`.\n\nIf you still want to do this, anyhow, just `require()` the `rusha.js` file, follow the instructions on _Using the Rusha Object_.\n\n### Browser\n\nRusha is available on [bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/) via `bower install rusha`.\n\nIt is highly recommended to run CPU-intensive tasks in a [Web Worker](http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Using_web_workers). To do so, just start a worker with `var worker = new Worker('rusha.js')` and start sending it jobs. Follow the instructions on _Using the Rusha Worker_.\n\nIf you can't, for any reason, use Web Workers, include the `rusha.js` file in a `<script>` tag and follow the instructions on _Using the Rusha Object_.\n\n## Using the Rusha Object\n\nYour instantiate a new Rusha object by doing `var r = new Rusha(optionalSizeHint)`. When created, it provides the following methods:\n\n- `Rusha#digest(d)`: Create a hex digest from data of the three kinds mentioned below, or throw and error if the type is unsupported.\n- `Rusha#digestFromString(s)`: Create a hex digest from a binary `String`. A binary string is expected to only contain characters whose charCode < 256.\n- `Rusha#digestFromBuffer(b)`: Create a hex digest from a `Buffer` or `Array`. Both are expected to only contain elements < 256.\n- `Rusha#digestFromArrayBuffer(a)`: Create a hex digest from an `ArrayBuffer` object.\n- `Rusha#rawDigest(d)`: Behaves just like #digest(d), except that it returns the digest as an Int32Array of size 5.\n\n## Using the Rusha Worker\n\nYou can send your instance of the web worker messages in the format `{id: jobid, data: dataobject}`. The worker then sends back a message in the format `{id: jobid, hash: hash}`, were jobid is the id of the job previously received and hash is the hash of the data-object you passed, be it a `Blob`, `Array`, `Buffer`, `ArrayBuffer` or `String`.\n\n## Development\n\n* Download npm dependencies with `npm install`\n* Source file to be edited is `rusha.sweet.js`\n* Build with `npm run build`\n* Run tests with `npm test`\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nTested were my Rusha implementation, the sha1.js implementation by [P. A. Johnston](http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/sha1.html), Tim Caswell's [Cifre](http://github.com/openpeer/cifre) and the Node.JS native implementation.\n\nIf you want to check the performance for yourself in your own browser, I compiled a [JSPerf Page](http://jsperf.com/rusha/13).\n\nA normalized estimation based on the best results for each implementation, smaller is better:\n![rough performance graph](http://srijs.github.io/rusha/bench/unscientific01.png)\n\nResults per Implementation and Platform:\n![performance chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/oimg?key=0Ag9CYh5kHpegdDB1ZG16WU1xVFgxdjRuQUVwQXRnWVE&oid=1&zx=pcatr2aits9)\n\nAll tests were performed on a MacBook Air 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5 and 4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3.\n",
