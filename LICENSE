1. Introduction
1.1 The Cloud9 Software Development Kit (referred to in this License Agreement

License Agreement.

1.2 Any software provided along with the SDK (such as some of the files in the
node_modules directory) that is associated with a separate license agreement is
licensed to you under the terms of that separate license agreement. 

This License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and Cloud9
in relation to your use of the SDK.

2.2 You agree to be bound by the terms of this SDK License by installing,
copying, downloading, accessing or otherwise using the SDK.

2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are
a person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or
other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which

3. The Cloud9 SDK
3.1 Cloud9 grants to you a non-exclusive, non-commercial, non-transferable,
personal license to do the following, all subject to the terms of this license:

Copy and modify any SDK source code, and include such copies and modifications
in software that you create (“Derived Software”), and include SDK object
code in Derived Software;

Use SDK source code, SDK object code, and Derived Software for your own
personal, noncommercial use;

Distribute Derived Software and SDK documentation to others, provided that any
distribution is for noncommercial purposes only, is without charge or fee or
consideration of any kind, and that every recipient of the distribution agree to
and is bound by the terms of this SDK License.

3.2 You agree that Cloud9 or third parties own all legal right, title and
interest in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that
subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights
under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and
all other proprietary rights. Cloud9 reserves all rights not expressly granted
to you. 

3.3 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by this

the SDK; 
Use anything in the SDK or any Derived Software for any commercial purpose,
including without limitation for provision of programming, hosting, or any other

attempt at such a transfer is void.

3.4 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under a
separate license agreement are governed solely by the terms of that separate
license agreement and not this License Agreement.

3.5 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Cloud9 provides may
change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be
incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You
agree that Cloud9 may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or
any features within the SDK) to you or to users generally at Cloud9's sole
discretion, without prior notice to you.

3.6 Nothing in this License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Cloud9's
trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other
distinctive brand features.

3.7 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights
notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or
contained within the SDK.

4. Privacy and Information
4.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Cloud9 may collect
certain usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique
identifier, associated IP address, version number of the software, and
information on which tools and/or services in the SDK are being used and how
they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the SDK will
notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will
not be collected.

4.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
maintained in accordance with Cloud9's Privacy Policy.

5. Your developer credentials
5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
any developer credentials that may be issued to you by Cloud9 or which you may
choose yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all applications
that are developed under your developer credentials.

6. Third party applications
6.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that
access data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that
Cloud9 is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources.
You understand that all data, content or resources which you may access through
such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from
which they originated and that Cloud9 is not liable for any loss or damage that
you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party
applications, data, content, or resources.

6.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you
through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property
rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on
their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create
derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or
in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the
relevant owners.

6.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data,
content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the
relevant third party. In that case, this License Agreement does not affect your
legal relationship with these third parties.
