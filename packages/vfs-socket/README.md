# vfs-socket

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/c9/vfs-socket.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/c9/vfs-socket)

A wrapper to use vfs instances remotely over a socket-like transport

TODO: Document this.

For now, read the setup phase of the unit tests. <https://github.com/c9/vfs-socket/blob/master/test/test-socket.js#L27-50>

From there it works more or less like vfs-local by design.
